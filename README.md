## Analysis with Big Data

## UEH Academic Project | Data Analyst & Team Leader | 04/2025 – 05/2025

**Analyzed and optimized supply chain performance using Big Data technologies and advanced analytics:**

- **Data Collection & Preparation:** Managed large datasets based on the 5V Big Data model. Cleaned nulls, duplicates, and inconsistent dates in Excel, standardized data, created temporary views, split data for training (70%) and testing (30%), and loaded datasets to Localhost via Hadoop.

- **Data Analysis with Spark SQL:** Identified business insights such as Top 5 high-revenue but low-profit products, customer churn patterns, interpurchase intervals, regions with highest late delivery rates, and RFM-based customer segmentation.

- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Built classification models in Python (Jupyter Notebook) using Logistic Regression and Random Forest, achieving 97.6% accuracy, 95.8% precision, and AUC = 0.97. Applied K-Means clustering (K=3) to categorize products by profitability:

  + Profitable: Avg. profit +46.47

  + Mild Loss: Avg. profit -142.73

  + High Loss: Avg. profit -567.22

- **Time Series Forecasting:** Used Prophet to predict 2-year sales trends, supporting workforce planning, inventory optimization, and seasonal marketing strategies.

**Technologies:** Spark SQL, Spark MLlib, Python (Jupyter Notebook), Hadoop, Excel, Prophet
